# DoodleJump but AI powered

This project aims to demonstrate how we can implement basic heuristics to train an AI to play a simple game like DoodleJump !

The AI is implemented using **C++** for efficiency and the game runs on **Python** for simplicity. The game was totally built from scratch so the AI can access values in real time.
